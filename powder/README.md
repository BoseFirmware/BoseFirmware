  <li>With firmware version 1.3.6 comes a change in the Noise Cancelling performance of QC30.  The Noise Cancellation has been improved in the lower frequencies to make it more consistent with QC20’s performance.</li>
  <li>Resolves an issue with WhatsApp and Facebook videos when using music sharing with another headset.  When audio is being played through two headsets using music sharing mode and the customer switches to Facebook or WhatsApp, the audio that was playing should pause and play the WhatsApp or Facebook audio through both headsets.
