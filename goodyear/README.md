<ul>
  <li>Address the issue with red and white blinking lights.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It will restore operability of the headset to all users impacted by red and white LEDs and allow any future red and white LEDs to be cleared by pressing the power button on the headset.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it will also build on the existing features originally released with v1.4.12. This version will be first made available to users who have already updated to 1.4.12.</li>
      </ul>
  <li>We will provide more information as to how members running versions of firmware prior to 1.4.12 can update to 1.5.1 or a firmware with the included features later, but felt it was important to release this fix to the customers most affected as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>To clarify, the red and white blinking LED status is meant to indicate that the NC700 has detected an error condition. The headset can enter this state with any firmware version. Even with firmware 1.5.1, it will still be possible for the headset to get into an error state. What firmware 1.5.1 does is provide the ability to clear the indicator if the error condition is no longer present.</li>
