&#9677; 1.2.0 : <a href="https://community.bose.com/t5/Headphones-Archive/Soundsport-Free-Firmware-Update-1-2-0-Available-10-18-17/td-p/80897">Oct 18, 2017</a></br>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes the issue where several unintentional tones are heard when removing the buds from the case while at 10% battery life. This includes a powering-on tone and two extra low battery tones. Now, the buds only play one low battery tone and no power on tones.</li>
  <li>Fixes the issue where the voice prompt states “Battery 100%” when removing the right bud from the case, even if the battery is not 100%.</li>
  <li>Fixes the issue where there is no alert tone when the buds power down. This only happens when the buds are left idle and set on a sleep timer.</li>
  <li>Fixes the issue where the “Low Battery” voice prompt is announced multiple times at different battery percentages instead of only once with five minutes of battery life remaining.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the Bose Connect app update does not resume when interrupted. If the over-the-air update starts while connected to a device and the headset is then disconnected and connected to a second device, the update does not resume. Now, the OTA resumes on the second device when connected via the app.</li>
  <li>Additional fixes for incorrect voice prompts that occur when answering calls in Korean, Mandarin or Japanese languages.</li>
  <li>Fixes a sync issue where the blinking blue LED on each earbud does not line up while in pairing mode.</li>
