<ul>
  <li>The introduction of multiple Acoustic Noise Cancellation (ANC) modes: High, Low and Off.
    <ul>
      <li>High – World-class noise cancellation with Bose optimized audio.  This is the same as full ANC and there have been no changes.</li>
      <li>Low – Noise Cancellation fine tuned for audio listening in quieter or windy environments.</li>
      <li>Off – Noise cancellation disabled.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With this new feature in place, it’s important to note that the audio quality in the “Off” mode is not as good as the active EQ when the ANC is on and enabled.</li>
  <li>These modes are only available in the Bose Connect App, as shown below, and cannot be accessed or adjusted using the headset controls.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the voice prompt language in both Mandarin and Japanese would announce the “call from name” in Chinese</li>

<ul>
  <li>Resolves an issue with WhatsApp and Facebook videos when using music sharing with another headset.
