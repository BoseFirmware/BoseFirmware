<h3><strong><br>How does Tile work with the Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have updated your Bose firmware to version 2.7.7 using the Bose Connect app and activated your Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones using the Tile app, the Tile technology inside your SoundSport Wireless headphones works in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/201161926-How-does-Tile-work-">same three ways</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"> as a Tile</span> normally would!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205040828-How-to-Ring-your-Tile"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ring your SoundSport Wireless headphones</span></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/220478948"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View your SoundSport Wireless headphones’ last known location on the map</span></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your SoundSport Wireless headphones utilize Tile’s Bluetooth tracking technology to find your headphones if it's hiding nearby or see the location of where your headphones were last connected, all within the Tile app on your phone.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><br>How will I know if my Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones have been activated with the Tile app?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways you can tell that your headphones have been activated by the Tile app:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tile app will show a Tile card with your SoundSport Wireless headphones as seen here:<img src="https://github.com/bosefirmware/ced/raw/master/images/tile_app_01.jpeg" width="308" height="537"></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After activation, when you power on the headphones, listen for the voice which says &nbsp;“Tile Activated.”<br><br>If you’ve purchased the headphones from a third party and the voiceover says “Tile Activated”, this means that the Tile integration was activated by the previous owner and must be disabled by the original owner. Please <a href="https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205348827-How-do-I-contact-Customer-Care-">contact Tile support</a> if you need any assistance.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong><br>My SoundSport Wireless headphones are not connecting to my Tile app, what can I do?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to worry, here are some quick things to check:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure your headphones are charged! Since the Tile integration uses the headphones' built-in battery, if the battery's charge level is below 10% then the headphones cannot power on or connect to the Tile app.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your smartphone. The Bose SoundSport Wireless are wireless headphones that connect with your smartphone via Bluetooth for normal audio playback and phone calls. The Tile app also uses Bluetooth to connect to the headphones briefly and update the location so you'll know where you last had them.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><strong>Android smartphones</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you'll especially want to check that Location Services are enabled. The Android operating system requires Location Services to be enabled to scan for Bluetooth devices. This is not specific to Tile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still having trouble connecting? Consider restarting your phone by powering it off, then back on. This can be especially helpful if you haven't turned off your phone in a long time. Restarting your phone helps to clear out any Bluetooth errors that can interfere with connectivity.</span></p>
<h3><strong><br>When I press "Find" in the Tile app, the volume of the finding tune seems low, why is that?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finding tune for the SoundSport Wireless will gradually increase, starting softly just in case your headphones are in your ears! Kindly wait for a few seconds and you'll hear the tune come up to full volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, when you "Find" your headphones, you’ll hear the headphones' "Tile Activated" message, as if the headphones are turned on. This can also delay the finding tune by a few seconds as the tune starts when the prompt is done.<br></span><strong><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are listening to music and press the “Find” button in the Tile app, you will hear this message: “The earbud locator alarm is about to go off, remove your earbuds now.” The tune does increase gradually but you’ll want to remove the headphones if you’re concerned about it getting too loud.</span>&nbsp;<br><br><br></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The location of my headphones is showing incorrectly in the Tile app, how can I fix this?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Please be sure that <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Location Services are enabled</span> on your smartphone and that <span class="wysiwyg-underline">location permissions are Always granted to the Tile app</span> - the Tile app needs access to your phone's location so that it can update your headphones when they connect to your phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. The <strong>Tile app uses your phone's native maps application</strong> to understand where it is in the world. Please open <strong>Apple Maps for iOS</strong> or <strong>Google Maps for Android</strong> if you don’t open these apps regularly. This will ensure that your phone's GPS information is reporting properly and will allow Tile to accurately locate your headphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Make sure your phone is not in Low Power (iOS) or Battery Saving (Android) modes to ensure that Location is updating properly. When in battery saving mode, the phone will update location information much less frequently, if at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. For more recent versions of </span><strong>Android</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially Android 8 (Oreo) and 9 (Pie), be sure to add the Tile app to the unrestricted apps list to allow it to always run in the background even if you haven't opened the app recently. This is how the Tile app is designed to work but sometimes the Android OS will stop the app from working if you haven't opened it recently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>I want to remove the TIle integration from my SoundSport Wireless headphones, can I add it back later?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! If you decide you'd like to remove the Tile integration from your headphones you can do so right in our Tile app, <strong><em>Please be sure that your Tile app is connected to the headphones so that the green "Find" button shows up on the Tile card. <br></em></strong><br>1. Simply open the app, tap the 3 dots on the SoundSport Tile card, then tap Details from the pop-up menu that appears:<br><img src="https://github.com/bosefirmware/ced/raw/master/images/tile_app_02.jpeg" alt="IMG_EEA25EF18D58-1.jpeg" width="309" height="536"><br><br>2. On the details screen, tap the red <strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-red90">Reset</span></strong> button:<br>&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/bosefirmware/ced/raw/master/images/tile_app_03.jpeg" alt="IMG_E333A798635A-1.jpeg" width="309" height="533">&nbsp;<br><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app will ask you to Confirm since this action is permanent. Not to worry though, if you want to use the Tile features later on, simply open the Tile app and tap the + to Activate the headphones again.<br><br><br></span></p>
